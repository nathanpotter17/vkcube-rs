## COMMERCIAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS

**This software implements revenue-based commercial licensing requirements in addition to standard CPAL terms.**

### FREE TIER (CPAL License)

You may use the X Engine under this CPAL license if:

- Your application/game has generated less than $200,000 USD in gross revenue in the trailing 12 months
- Attribution is prominently displayed ("Powered by X Engine")
- All modifications remain open source under this CPAL

- Requires professional support or custom licensing terms

### REVENUE SHARE MODEL

For applications/games generating over $200,000 USD in gross revenue:

- **2.5% royalty** on gross revenue above $200,000 USD per application/game

- Quarterly reporting and payment required

### REVENUE COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

**Mandatory Revenue Reporting:** Applications/games approaching or exceeding $200,000 USD in gross revenue must provide quarterly revenue reports to nathanscottpotter@gmail.com.

**Automatic License Violation:** Using Covered Code in applications/games generating $200,000+ USD without a valid commercial license constitutes material breach and willful copyright infringement.

- Immediate injunctive relief to cease distribution
- Monetary damages including lost royalty payments
- Attorney's fees and court costs
- Enhanced damages for willful infringement

**Audit Rights:** NSP LLC may audit revenue reports and request supporting documentation with 30 days written notice.

**Enforcement Exception:** The liability limitations in Sections 7 and 9 do not prevent NSP LLC from recovering monetary damages directly related to license violations (such as unpaid royalties, licensing fees, and attorney's fees), but do not create any other form of liability for NSP LLC regarding the use, misuse, or performance of the Covered Code.

### ENTERPRISE LICENSING

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute.

### 3.5 Required Notices

You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may distribute the Executable version under a license of Your choice, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License.

All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

### 8.2 Patent Litigation Termination

If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor alleging that such party's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such party to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon 60 days notice from such party.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT NSP LLC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

## 14. ADDITIONAL TERM: ATTRIBUTION

(a) As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the Original Code ("Original Developer"), in the hope that its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Original Code, NSP LLC includes in Exhibit B ("Attribution Information") a requirement that each time an Executable and Source Code or a Larger Work is launched or initially run (which includes initiating a session), a prominent display of NSP LLC's Attribution Information (as defined below) must occur on the graphic user interface employed by the end user to access such Covered Code (which may include display on a splash screen), if any.

The term "External Deployment" means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Code or Modifications in any way such that the Original Code or Modifications may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Code or Modifications as a distribution under section 3.1 and make Source Code available under Section 3.2.
